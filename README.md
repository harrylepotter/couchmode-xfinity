# CouchMode for Xfinity Live TV	
CouchMode is a Chrome Extension that turns your browser into a set-top box for watching live television. 
A minimalist onscreen display lets you see the channel you&quot;re watching</p>

It is somewhat similar to <a href="https://vimeo.com/couchmode">Vimeo Couch mode</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/tv#/">Youtube leanback mode</a>, but for live TV. </p>

To get started, you'll need:
		<ol>
			<li>A Comcast Xfinity account with subscription to channels. &quot;remember me&quot; must be used to store the account details in the browser</li>
			<li>A remote and remote software - For mac, I recommend <a href="https://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/">Remote Buddy</a></li>
			<li> Map your remote control buttons to the following:
				<ul>
					<li><kbd>o</kbd> Channel Up </li>
					<li><kbd>p</kbd> Channel Down </li>
					<li><kbd>w</kbd> Change channel to selection </li>
				<ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
That's about all there is to it.
